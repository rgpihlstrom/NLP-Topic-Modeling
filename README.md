## Results 60% Coherence, 6 Topics!

This project uses LDA Topic Modeling, an unsupervised algorithm, to discover the latent topics mentioned by consumers in approximately 3000 product reviews of the most popular ananalog plant-based meat products.  By scraping data from the most popular retail and social media sites I create two sets of topic models: 1 set of 4 topics for positively rated reviews and another set of 2 topics for negatively rated reviewes.  The algorithm was able to acheive coherence scores of <b><ins>50%</ins></b> and <b><ins>60%</ins></b> respectively.  The following were the most dominate topics for each segment of data:

Additionally, I experimented with using Naive Bayes, a supervised algorithm, to try attribute a numberical rating to reviews that otherwise did not have an accompaning numberical/ stars rating.  By leveraging and learning from past pre-rated, positivly (4-5 Stars) or negativly (1-3 stars) reviews, I attempted to classify twitter reviews, which are not rated, into a positve or negative category repectively.  Unfortunately, this experiment was not successful, having sever overfitting (Training/ validation <b><ins>93%</ins></b>, Testing <b><ins>76%</ins></b>)  See below for more details as there are areas for improvement.  

 
 ## Business Problem
Grocery sales for plant-based meats are up 47% vs. year ago, and research suggests the acceptance of plant-based burgers by mainstream consumer is starting to become reality. A large portion of this growth is coming from the two most dominate brands/products: Impossible and Beyond.

#### The Current Situation: 
The CEO of Sunrise Health Foods is looking to enter the growing category with a new product.  However, given the high rate of failure for new product launches, coupled with the high costs for entry he/she is looking to create a product that is uniquely better than industry competitors.  In order to create a new and uniuque product, unique insights are needed.  He has hired me to review the vast number of product reviews captured for industry leaders from the most popular sites and formulate my findings into a set of product attributes that can then be leverage by the R&D team as it begins its product development efforts.

### Business Questions Driving Model Development.
 The intended output of this theoretical business case is focused on the following:
-   **1. Identify The Key Sentiments & Topics Menentioned From Product Review Sites.**
-   **2. Examples Good & Bad Product Attributes the R&D Team Should Consider During their Development Efforts.**
-   **3. Attempt to Project Ratings from Rated Reviews on to Unrated reviews.**

## Data

The data used for this project was scraped from the below sites in the listed quantities:  The dataset contains approximately 3k reviews and required the use of selenium and Scrapy to procure along with twint for the reviews obtained from twitter.

## Model Development Methods
This project uses the Crisp DM methodology to generate and optimize the models.  Crisp DM requires blending business strategy, availabled data, and modeling techniques best suited to the business drivers.  Model development is and was very iterative.  I began by doing secondary research around the basic business drivers of the industry, and gaining a better understanding on the top selling products and brands (thanks to my friends a IRI :) ).  Along with the project requirements noted above, the following additional factors were considered during the modeling process:
-   **1. Data Imbalance**  Early in the development process it was obvious that I was dealing with an imbalanced set of data (more information/ rows of data on positive reviews vs. negative reviews).  During topic modeling, to ensure optimum identification of topics and product attributes, I split the data into two sets: positive and negative.  Furthre more during the text classification portion of the project I needed to account for this imbalance.  I addresd this gap by using SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) during my Bayes classification portion.

- **2. Selection of Unsupervised Topic Models**  Initially I tried several different types of topic models, ranging from Mallets LDA,  HDP, LSA, and Multicore LDA.  Ultimately, I decided to use <b><ins>Gensims Multicore LDA</ins></b> , as this topic model continued to produce more coherent topics with higher coherence scores during my iterative approach to modeling.  During the text classifiers portion of the project I choose Naive Bayes as it outperformed other ML classifiers.

- **3. Techincal Challenges - LDA using Reviews of Few Words:**  Finding the number of topics, finding The "right" words for each Topic and finding topics that represented a portion of each doc/ review with a very iterative process.  LDA Topic modeling is a technique that is considered a "soft" classifier and interpeting its results are part-art-part-science.  Experts suggest the higher the coherence the better but the max coherence score acheived during topic modeling does not alway acheive the most interpretable/ translatable topics.  During this project I acheive coherence scores that ranged from .2 - .72.  Ultimately I chose hyperameteres that created models that reached greater than .45 and then selected the number of topics per dataset based on iterpretabilty and my domain knowledge on the subject, as I have over 15 years of experience in the food innovation space.  I also cross referenced my number selected topics per dataset against a Kmeans elbow graph ensure alignment.  Lastly, I used LDA vis to ensure separation of topics.  Below are the results from both the positive and negative datasets

## Model Results - Topic Modeling
After several iterations, the below topic models were created <b><ins>50% Coherence - Positive Reviews</ins></b>, accuracy <b><ins>60% Coherence - Negative Reviews</ins></b>, These results were acheived using the <b><ins>LDA Multicore in Gensim</ins></b>.  It's important to remember these results were acheived with a focus on interpretability.

<h4>Topic Model Results Explained:</h4>
<h5>Topics Derived From Positivly Rated Reviews</h5>
<strong> - Topic 0</strong> = <b><ins>NEW FAMILY FAVORITE</ins></b> Per the pyvis graph above this was by far the most dominate topic in the positive set of reviews.  In Studing the reveiws most associated with the topic and key words this topic can be called  as the reviews here were raving about the simliarity to real meat, great taste, great substiture for beef<br/>
<strong> - Topic 1</strong> = <b><ins>WORTH THE SACRIFICE</ins></b> as the reviews most associated with this topic and the dominate words correlated quality texttures, reception of price, filling, and being impressed, despite a few concerns on long/ odd ingredient lists aka (chemicals)<br/>
<strong> - Topic 2</strong> = <b><ins>RIGHT PROPOSITION</ins></b> as the reviews most associated with this topic and the dominate words correlated with size of the product and number of items contained in the package along with all the benefits associated with animal and eco friendly. <br/>
<strong> - Topic 3</strong> = <b><ins>GUILT  FREE CONVENIENCE </ins></b> as the reviews most associated with this topic and the dominate words correlated with easy of use, versatility and the health benefits associated with avoid the hormons associated with non-organic beef farms


<h3>Topics Derived From Negatively Rated Reviews</h3>
<strong> - Topic 0</strong> = <b><ins>BUYER BEWARE</ins></b> Per the pyvis graph above this was by far the most dominate topic in the negetive set of reviews.  The reviews here were blasting the horrible smells, resembalance to wet petfood and its very large gap between the textures offered vs. real beef.
<br/>
<strong> - Topic 1</strong> = <b><ins>NOT WORTH THE SACRIFICE</ins></b> as the reviews most associated with this topic and the dominate words correlated with long list of ingredients, ingredients that cannot be pronounced (aka chemicals) and the high cost relative to beef.
<br/>

<br/><br/>
<strong>***Key Take Away/ Product Attributes to Target</strong> = Well received all around, meeting many needs for consumers desire for: <b><ins>Taste, Texture, Convenience, Price, Eco</ins></b>… willing to “put up” with <b><ins>Smell and Ingredient list</ins></b>… at least for now... however as a R&D staff they should target:  <b><ins>SMELL, APPEARANC, PRICING, INGREDIENTS </ins></b> as opportunities to offer something new and unique to the market.

<h4>Reviewing Extending Model From Rated Reviews to Non-Rated REviews:</h4>
<h5>TBD</h5>

### Observations:
- ABC.



## Next Steps

- **MORE DATA - Encourage Retailers to Motivate Consumer Reviews** - More & Diverity of Thought: In order to encourge this type of analysis in the future and accross several categories more reivews would be helpful, also pushing consumer to generate organic thoughts for targeted product attributes, dislikes, etc.

- **Entending Rated Modles to Classify/ Rate non-rated content** - Given the prevalance of popular social media centered forms such as twitter, tic-tok, FB and other the need to incorpate thes reviews from these sites is obvious.  However without a mechinism for the consumer to quantity their feelings of these sites the manufacturer struggles to use the data from these sites effectively.  By using the XYZ method to develop an internal classifier would be benefical.

- **Monitoring Video Content** - While scraping sites such as twitter I encountered several reviews that were notincorporated into this analysis as most of the reivews on twitter were really just a promotion vehicle to a video on youtube actually showing the review on tape.  Undering and getting this data in a fashion that would allow for analysis would be invaluable
